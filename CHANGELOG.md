## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **AlphaFactory → Evolution Integration**: Factor discovery pipeline now triggers
  automatically during evolution when conventional reflection yields no improvements.
  LLM generates candidate indicator code → sandboxed execution → statistical
  validation → dynamic registration → strategy injection.
- **Structural Mutation (CHANGE_LOGIC)**: Evolution can now switch entry logic
  between AND/OR. Heuristic fallback triggers when many AND conditions produce
  too few signals.
- **Factor Discovery Mutation (DISCOVER_FACTOR)**: New ChangeType allows the
  evolution loop to inject LLM-discovered factors as strategy conditions.
- **Portfolio-Level Backtesting**: `PortfolioBacktester` simulates execution with
  $100K initial capital, max 5 concurrent positions, 20% position sizing.
  Reports portfolio drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and capital utilization.
- **LLM vs Param_Search Baseline**: After LLM/hybrid evolution, the pipeline
  automatically runs a param_search-only baseline for comparison.
  Shows incremental value of LLM reflection.
- **Experimental Strategy Marking**: Strategies using proxy indicators
  (event_driven_breakout, sector_rotation_leader) now have `experimental: true`
  in their YAML meta. CLI displays ⚠️ warning in `strategy list` and `strategy show`.
- **Demo Synthetic Data Disclaimer**: Demo now clearly states results use synthetic
  data and suggests `alphaevo demo --real` for real market data.
- **Strategy Drafting CLI**: `alphaevo strategy draft` and `alphaevo strategy revise`
  convert plain-language ideas into executable strategy YAML and support iterative edits.
- **One-Shot Research CLI**: `alphaevo strategy research` drafts a plain-language
  strategy, saves it, backtests it, and can run entry-parameter plus exit/risk
  optimization in one command.
- **Research Advice Reports**: one-shot research now writes deterministic next-step
  guidance based on sample size, payoff profile, overfit diagnostics, and exit diagnostics.
- **Strategy Improve CLI**: `alphaevo strategy improve` applies a bounded
  natural-language revision to an existing strategy, backtests it, can run
  parameter/exit optimization, and writes advice.
- **Explicit Entry/Exit Semantics**: DSL adds `entry.triggers`, `entry.guards`, and
  `exit.triggers` so buy signals, hard filters, and sell signals are independently backtestable.
- **Exit/Risk Optimizer**: `alphaevo optimize` searches sell triggers, stop loss,
  take profit, and max holding rules, with optional best-candidate YAML export.
- **Parameter Optimizer**: `alphaevo optimize --spaces entry,params,indicator`
  now searches executable `params.tunable` entry thresholds and indicator windows
  on the same sampled market data.
- **Optimization Gates**: `alphaevo optimize` supports `--objective win_rate`,
  `--min-win-rate`, `--min-avg-return`, `--min-profit-loss-ratio`,
  `--max-drawdown`, `--min-signals`, and `--param-max-changes` so candidates
  can be judged against explicit qualification thresholds such as 50%+ win rate
  without negative expectancy or weak payoff quality.
- **Balanced Quality Objective**: `alphaevo optimize --objective quality`
  ranks candidates by a blended score across win rate, average return,
  profit/loss ratio, drawdown, and signal count.
- **Return-Focused Objective**: `alphaevo optimize --objective profit_quality`
  ranks candidates by average return, total return, payoff ratio, win rate,
  and drawdown for cases where positive but thin returns are not enough.
- **Robust Return Objective**: `alphaevo optimize --objective robust_profit_quality`
  blends return quality with anti-overfit and walk-forward stability scores.
- **Total Return Gate**: `alphaevo optimize` supports `--min-total-return`
  and optimization reports now show total return alongside average return.
- **Fast Optimization Evaluation**: candidate search now supports
  `--evaluation-mode fast` plus `--full-eval-top` so large grids can screen on
  trade metrics first and fully re-evaluate only the leading candidates.
- **Parallel Optimization Search**: `alphaevo optimize --parallel-workers`
  evaluates parameter and exit/risk candidates concurrently for larger
  return-quality and joint-search runs.
- **Robust Optimization Gates**: `alphaevo optimize` can reject candidates
  flagged by anti-overfit checks or by train/validation/test and walk-forward
  performance gaps via `--reject-overfit`, `--max-train-val-gap`,
  `--max-val-test-gap`, `--max-walk-forward-gap`, and
  `--min-walk-forward-pass-rate`.
- **Best Strategy Candidate Summary**: optimization output and reports now show
  the best high-win/high-return candidate as a readable strategy summary,
  including metrics, rule changes, entry/exit rules, and any gate-failure
  reasons.
- **Joint Entry+Exit Search**: `alphaevo optimize --joint-top` now refines the
  leading entry/parameter candidates with exit/risk optimization so buy-side
  filters and sell-side rules can be evaluated together. Joint seeds are
  diversified across win rate, return, total return, and payoff ratio.
- **Trailing Take-Profit Search**: exit optimization now tests trailing
  take-profit candidates alongside fixed reward/risk targets.
- **Breakout/Compression Strategy Template**: Added `breakout_high_Nd` and
  `price_position_Nd` OHLCV indicators plus the
  `volatility_compression_breakout_v1` built-in strategy with explicit breakout
  triggers, volatility-compression guards, and trailing profit capture.
- **Breakout-Aware Strategy Drafting**: `alphaevo strategy draft` now maps
  plain-language breakout/new-high ideas to executable breakout triggers,
  range-position guards, and trailing take-profit rules.
- **Exit Diagnostics**: Optimization reports now summarize MFE/MAE, giveback,
  potentially early exits, late exits, effective stops, and truncated take profits.
- **Backtest Fill Policy**: Added configurable same-candle stop-loss/take-profit
  conflict handling via `backtest.fill_policy` / `--fill-policy`.
- **Daily Stock Analysis Adapter**: Added the `dsa` data adapter path for reusing
  daily_stock_analysis market data through AlphaEvo's adapter boundary.

### Changed
- Default `alphaevo showcase` now runs a six-step validated mutation chain on
  the bundled yfinance snapshot, improving the reproducible no-key RSI showcase
  from 8.1% to a 68.7% champion while lowering max drawdown to 23.6%.
- `ChangeType` enum extended with `CHANGE_LOGIC` and `DISCOVER_FACTOR`
- `StrategyMeta` model gains `experimental: bool = False` field
- `EvolutionResult` gains `baseline_param_search_score: float | None` field
- Serializer omits `experimental: false` from YAML output to avoid clutter
- LLM reflection prompts now include `change_logic` and `discover_factor` as
  valid change types
- Backtesting now treats `entry.triggers` as the preferred buy signal group and
  falls back to legacy `entry.conditions` for existing strategy YAML.
