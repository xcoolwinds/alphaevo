## Champion Diagnostics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Signals | 37 |
| Win Rate | 48.6% |
| Average Return | 2.94% |
| Sequential Total Return | 140.56% |
| Profit/Loss Ratio | 2.46 |

The champion remains a showcase result, not an official benchmark: it uses a fixed five-symbol snapshot and should be revalidated on broader universes before any serious research claim.

## Research Committee

| Round | Analyst | Status | Verdict |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Technical Analyst | fail | Entry stack is too strict for a reliable research sample. |
| 1 | Risk Analyst | pass | Drawdown and loss clustering are within the research tolerance band. |
| 1 | Overfit Critic | fail | Sample is too small to trust improvement claims. |
| 1 | Data Quality Auditor | pass | Data source and symbol basket are explicit enough for a showcase. |
| 1 | Mutation Planner | pass | Plan starts by unlocking enough signals for a valid retest. |
| 2 | Technical Analyst | fail | Signals are tradable but expected return is not yet positive. |
| 2 | Risk Analyst | fail | Drawdown is too high for promotion. |
| 2 | Overfit Critic | fail | Anti-overfit checks reject promotion. |

## Mutation Evidence

### Round 2: `rsi_reversion_v2`
- `entry.logic` changed from `and` to `or`.
  Rationale: Baseline fired too few signals; test OR logic to unlock oversold reversal candidates without adding complexity.

### Round 3: `rsi_reversion_v3`
- `exit.stop_loss.value` changed from `0.05` to `0.08`.
  Rationale: Losses were being cut inside normal volatility; test a wider stop and require the retest to improve.

### Round 4: `rsi_reversion_v4`
- `exit.max_holding_days` changed from `10` to `14`.
  Rationale: Mean reversion needed more time to complete; test a longer holding window while watching drawdown.

### Round 5: `rsi_reversion_v5`
- `exit.take_profit.value` changed from `2.0` to `6.0`.
  Rationale: Validated high-volume reversals needed a larger payoff target; test a wider reward multiple instead of taking profits too early.

### Round 6: `rsi_reversion_v6`
- `entry.conditions[indicator=close_to_ma20_pct].indicator` changed from `close_to_ma20_pct` to `close_to_ma60_pct`.
  Rationale: A longer support anchor reduced whipsaw drawdown on the snapshot; test MA60 proximity as the reversal support context.

### Round 7: `rsi_reversion_v7`
- `entry.conditions[indicator=volume_ratio_1d_5d].value` changed from `1.3` to `2.0`.
  Rationale: After OR logic unlocked signals, require stronger volume confirmation to filter weaker rebounds.
