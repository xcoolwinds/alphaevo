# Contributing to AlphaEvo

Thank you for your interest in AlphaEvo! This guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Python >= 3.10**
- **Git**
- A virtual environment tool (`venv`, `conda`, etc.)

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ZhuLinsen/alphaevo.git
cd alphaevo

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Verify everything works
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## Coding Standards

For the full set of rules, see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Key points:

- **Pydantic v2 models** for all public interfaces — no bare `dict`.
- **No hardcoded** secrets, paths, model names, or ports. Use `AppConfig` or environment variables.
- **UTC datetimes** — use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for all time-related defaults.
- **Type hints** on all public functions and methods.
- **Respect directory boundaries** — don't put backtest logic in `strategy/`, etc.
- **`__init__.py`** with type exports required for every new module.
- Strategies must have both a **human-readable description** and an **executable DSL**.

## Git & Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add RSI indicator to registry
fix: correct walk-forward window overlap
docs: update CLI command reference
refactor: extract condition evaluator from engine
test: add backtest engine edge cases
chore: bump pydantic to 2.6
```

## Testing

All new features **must** have corresponding tests.

- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/`.
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`.

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Run only unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -q

# Run a specific test file
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_parser.py -v
```

## Linting

```bash
# Check for errors
ruff check src/ --select E,W,F

# Auto-fix where possible
ruff check src/ --select E,W,F --fix
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes, following the coding standards above.
3. Add or update tests as needed.
4. Run the full test suite and linter to make sure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -q && ruff check src/ --select E,W,F
   ```
5. Submit a PR with the following in the description:
   - **What changed** — summary of the changes.
   - **Why** — motivation or linked issue.
   - **Test results** — paste test output or describe how you verified.
   - **Risk assessment** — anything that might break, edge cases, or known limitations.

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass (`python -m pytest tests/ -q`)
- [ ] Lint passes (`ruff check src/ --select E,W,F`)
- [ ] New public APIs use Pydantic v2 models
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or paths
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Contributing Strategies

Strategy YAML files live in `strategies/builtin/`. To contribute a new strategy:

1. Create a YAML file following the [Strategy DSL spec](AGENTS.md#7-策略-dsl-规范-v03).
2. Include complete `meta`, `description`, `universe`, `entry`, `exit`, and `params` sections.
3. Make sure it parses cleanly:
   ```python
   from alphaevo.strategy.dsl.parser import StrategyParser
   strategy = StrategyParser.parse_file("strategies/builtin/your_strategy.yaml")
   print(strategy)
   ```
4. Add a brief comment in the PR explaining the strategy's thesis and target market conditions.

### Strategy Quality Guidelines

- Entry conditions should be specific and testable against OHLCV data.
- Avoid excessive conditions (> 8 total) — complexity is penalized.
- Include tunable parameters with reasonable ranges.
- Add `meta.preferred_regime` if the strategy targets specific market environments.

## Reporting Issues

When filing an issue, please include:

- AlphaEvo version (`alphaevo version`)
- Python version (`python --version`)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Relevant logs or error messages
